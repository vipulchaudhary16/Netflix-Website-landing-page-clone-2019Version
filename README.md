You can see preview of this site [here](https://netflix-2019.netlify.app/)

Once I was just chilling and one of my collegemates told me that his first project of Web Development is a Netflix clone. I was surprised, How !! Netflix Colne.
But after that, I came to know that It was just a landing page. So I also tried to do this.

As always I searched on YouTube and I got a very decent tutorial and I started following that and In one day I completed this.

Used some stock images from the various platform and with HTML, CSS, and JS I completed It.

After this project I came to know the use of the following attributes of CSS:ðŸ‘‡
  1. ::after
  2. box-shadow
  3. :root
  4. grid
  5. nth child()
