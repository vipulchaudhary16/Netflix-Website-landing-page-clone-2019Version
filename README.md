# Netflix-Website-landing-page-clone-2019Version

Once I was just chilling and one of my collegemates told me that his first project of Web Development is a Netflix clone. I was surprised, How !! Netflix Colne.
But after that, I came to know that It was just a landing page. So I also tried to do this.

As always I searched on YouTube and I got a very decent tutorial and I started following that and In one day I completed this.

Used some stock images from the various platform and with HTML, CSS, and JS I completed It.

After this project I came to know the use of the following attributes of CSS:ðŸ‘‡
  âœ”::after
  âœ”box-shadow
  âœ”:root
  âœ”grid
  âœ”nth child()
  
 Cause There was I haven't done any project in which I used this
